1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans:var --> Var is a function scope variable. Var can be declared multiple times with the same name. This is an old method and it is not very reliable because it can cause many problems in the program.
let --> Let is limited within the block scope. It cannot be declared more than once, but the value can be changed. To use the value of let, it must be declared first.
const --> Const is limited within the block scope. Once a value is assigned to it, it cannot be changed. It is usually used to hold const values.



2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
Ans: Map --> Map() is basically used to return a new array by operating on each element.
forEach --> forEach() is basically used to loop through each element of an array. It does not return any return value (returns undefined).
filter --> Filter() basically selects elements according to a condition and returns a new array. It will only return elements that match the condition.


3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Ans:Arrow functions are a new type of function introduced in ES6 that allows you to write functions in a shorthand way. They do not require the function keyword, but instead use the (arrow) symbol.


4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Ans: Destructuring assignment is a shortcut system introduced in ES6 that allows you to easily separate a value from an array or object and assign it to a variable.


5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?র্
Ans:Template literals are a new string syntax introduced in ES6, which is written with `(backtick)`. In this, Variable or expression can be placed directly inside ${ }. Using this, Multi-line string can be written easily. We know that Concatenation has to use + symbol and in contrast to this, Template literal uses backtick + ${ } which makes the code clean & readable.
